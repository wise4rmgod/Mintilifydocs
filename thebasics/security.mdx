At Interswitch, securing your personal information and transaction details and consistently keeping these confidential is our utmost priority.

We take stringent and appropriate measures to protect the security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access to such information.

## HTTPS for secure connections

Interswitch implements OAuth as a means of authentication and requires that all data are passed through HTTPS.

HTTPS **(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is a secure version of HTTP. It prevents sniffing of transferred data. All our APIs leverage HTTPS.
End-to-end safety of data is guaranteed over HTTPS, there is no need for additional encryption of data.

  HTTPS reduces packet sniffing and timing & replay attacks. With HTTPS, data exchanged between us and the merchant is protected 
  and sure to be authentic. HTTPS implements hashed signatures, nonces and other cryptographic safeties.
